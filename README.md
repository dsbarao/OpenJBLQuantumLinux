# OpenJBLQuantum

Open-source Linux tooling for JBL Quantum headsets, initially focused on the
JBL Quantum 810 wireless dongle. The project began with safe device detection
and now includes documented, allowlisted read-only status queries.

## Current status

Research scaffold. On the initial CachyOS host, the dongle was detected as
`0ecb:2069` (`Harman International Inc`, `JBL Quantum810 Wireless`). It exposes
five USB Audio-class interfaces and one HID-class interface. See
[`docs/inventory/initial-cachyos.md`](docs/inventory/initial-cachyos.md).

Passive experiments have confirmed Input Reports for headset presence,
noise-control mode, Bluetooth state, microphone mute, and the 15-position
Game/Chat dial. Battery percentage and selected QuantumENGINE controls have
been confirmed through controlled USBPcap comparisons. The evidence ledger
links every conclusion to its experiment.

## Safety boundary

The repository currently permits passive discovery plus one allowlisted status
read:

- read Linux `sysfs` and udev metadata;
- inspect descriptors already exported by the kernel;
- enumerate ALSA/PipeWire nodes when accessible;
- never open `/dev/hidraw*` or `/dev/bus/usb/*` for writing;
- query only battery Feature Report `0x49` through Linux `HIDIOCGFEATURE`;
- open hidraw read-only and provide no SET_FEATURE or output-report API;
- never issue device writes, resets, driver detach, firmware operations, or
  guessed commands.

Any future active experiment must first be documented with provenance,
expected bytes, rollback/risk analysis, and explicit opt-in.

## Quick start

```bash
python3 tools/detect_quantum.py
./tools/inventory.sh
```

Both tools are read-only. `inventory.sh` prints to stdout; redirect it into the
ignored `work/` directory if a local snapshot is wanted.

### Rust CLI prerequisite on CachyOS

The `openjblquantum` command does not exist until the project has been compiled
and installed. On CachyOS, install `rustup` from an interactive terminal, then
select the stable toolchain:

```bash
sudo pacman -S --needed rustup
rustup default stable
rustc --version
cargo --version
```

The Rust CLI is a dependency-free skeleton. Run it directly from the repository:

```bash
cargo check
cargo run -- scan
cargo run -- inspect
cargo run -- hid-descriptor
cargo run -- monitor --dry-run
cargo run -- status --dry-run
cargo run -- status --format json
cargo run -- notify --dry-run
cargo run -- export --format json
```

Only after that succeeds, optionally install the command for the current user:

```bash
cargo install --path .
openjblquantum scan
```

After changing the source, replace an older installed development build with:

```bash
cargo install --path . --force
openjblquantum inspect
```

If Cargo reports a successful install but Fish cannot find the command, add
Cargo's user binary directory to Fish's persistent path and start a new shell:

```fish
fish_add_path $HOME/.cargo/bin
openjblquantum scan
```

For a Bash session already open, update that session with:

```bash
export PATH="$HOME/.cargo/bin:$PATH"
openjblquantum scan
```

`inspect` reports the full standard USB interface/endpoint topology from the
descriptor blob already exported by the kernel and correlates matching ALSA
cards and PCM nodes. `export --format json` emits the same data as structured,
version-friendly JSON.

`hid-descriptor` passively decodes the HID report descriptor already exported
by the kernel. It reports usage pages, Report IDs, directions, and sizes; it
does not open a hidraw device or send a HID request.

`monitor --dry-run` resolves the matching hidraw node by HID identity without
opening it. `monitor` uses a read-only file handle and prints only spontaneous
Input Reports until interrupted with Ctrl-C. It contains no write path and
does not issue HID ioctls or USB control requests. Confirmed report meanings
are appended as annotations while the original bytes remain visible.

`status --dry-run` validates the matched character device without opening it.
`status` opens hidraw read-only and performs only the allowlisted
`HIDIOCGFEATURE` read for Report `0x49`, then validates and prints battery
percentage. Hardware validation returned `49 3c` (60%). The code contains no
SET_FEATURE or output-report path.

`status --format json` performs the same single allowlisted read and emits a
versioned object suitable for scripts and desktop widgets. It can be combined
with `--dry-run`; in that mode the battery fields are `null` and the device is
not opened.

`notify` performs the same single battery read and displays it through the
desktop notification service (`notify-send`). At 20% or below the notification
uses critical urgency. `notify --dry-run` does not open the device or display a
notification.

`show` opens a visible KDE dialog with the battery percentage. The application
launcher uses this command so clicking it produces a window instead of a
transient notification.

An optional KDE application launcher is included. Install it for the current
user after installing the CLI:

```bash
install -Dm644 packaging/kde/openjblquantum-battery.desktop \
  "$HOME/.local/share/applications/openjblquantum-battery.desktop"
```

It then appears in the application menu as **JBL Quantum 810 Battery**.

### Plasma 6 panel widget

The repository also includes a native Plasma 6 widget with a compact panel
indicator. It receives state-change signals from the user daemon and retains a
low-frequency fallback refresh. While the USB-C charging connection
(`0ecb:206a`) is present, the widget changes to cyan and displays a lightning
indicator.

The CLI, widget, launcher, and user service can be validated and installed
together with the idempotent helper. `--check` makes no changes:

```bash
tools/install-user.sh --check
tools/install-user.sh
```

The helper does not install the privileged udev rule and does not restart the
Plasma shell. For manual widget installation, use:

```bash
kpackagetool6 --type Plasma/Applet --install \
  packaging/plasma/org.openjblquantum.battery
```

For later development updates, use:

```bash
kpackagetool6 --type Plasma/Applet --upgrade \
  packaging/plasma/org.openjblquantum.battery
```

Then enter Plasma edit mode, choose **Add Widgets**, search for
**JBL Quantum 810 Battery**, and drag it to the panel. The widget invokes only
allowlisted `openjblquantum` commands. Its popup includes expandable controls for ambient
mode (off/ANC/TalkThru), global lighting (on/off), and hardware sidetone
(off/low/medium/high). These controls send only the confirmed two-byte Feature
Reports documented under `docs/protocol/`; arbitrary reports are rejected by
the CLI parser.

For real-time state tracking, install and enable the user service:

```bash
install -Dm644 packaging/systemd/openjblquantum-state.service \
  "$HOME/.config/systemd/user/openjblquantum-state.service"
systemctl --user daemon-reload
systemctl --user enable --now openjblquantum-state.service
```

The service opens the confirmed Quantum 810 hidraw node read-only, records only
known Input Reports, and writes a versioned cache under `XDG_RUNTIME_DIR`.
Unknown state remains `null`; it is never guessed.

If the monitor reports permission denied, install the narrowly scoped udev
rule and reconnect the dongle:

```bash
sudo install -m 0644 packaging/udev/70-openjblquantum.rules /etc/udev/rules.d/70-openjblquantum.rules
sudo udevadm control --reload-rules
```

The rule matches only USB device `0ecb:2069`, HID interface `05`, and uses
systemd-logind's `uaccess` mechanism. It does not use world-writable mode,
create a privileged daemon, or grant access to unrelated hidraw devices.

## Repository layout

- `docs/protocol/`: evidence ledger and protocol hypotheses;
- `docs/reverse-engineering.md`: capture workflow and safety gates;
- `docs/windows-vm-capture.md`: controlled QuantumENGINE/USBPcap workflow;
- `docs/plan-v0.1.md`: milestone definition;
- `tools/`: passive host/device inventory utilities;
- `src/`: future Linux CLI, currently passive sysfs detection only;
- `captures/`: local capture staging; capture files are ignored by Git.

## Confirmed passive mappings

| Report | Values | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `0x02` | `00/01/02` | noise control off / ANC / TalkThru |
| `0x03` | `00/01/02` | Bluetooth disconnected / connected / pairing |
| `0x06` | `00/01` | microphone muted / active |
| `0x07` | `00/01` | lighting disabled / enabled |
| `0x08` | `00–64` | battery percentage (0–100 decimal) |
| `0x09` | `00/01` | headset off-disconnected / on-connected |
| `0x10` | `00–06, 08, 0a–10` | Game/Chat balance, normalized -7…+7 |
| `0x2f` | bit 1 | HID Telephony Phone Mute pulse |

QuantumENGINE startup returned Feature Report `0x49` with `0x5a` while the
dongle emitted Input Report `08 5a`. A later controlled lighting capture emitted
`08 55`, confirming the Input Report payload tracks the changing battery
percentage (90%, then 85%).

## Scope

Linux is the development host. A Windows VM with QuantumENGINE,
USBPcap/Wireshark, and controlled USB passthrough is reserved for later
observation of known-good vendor traffic. No protocol claim should be treated
as fact until linked to repeatable evidence.

## Contributing

Do not submit firmware, proprietary binaries, personal identifiers, or raw
captures that may include unrelated USB traffic. Prefer small sanitized byte
sequences with timestamps removed and document hardware/firmware versions.
